# This project is archived
Leaving this publicly archived as a reference for our UMD INST377 semester project. No updates are intended to be pushed, and all test environments/APIs most likely don't work anymore. 

# HomeCheck
HomeCheck is a web application built on HTML/CSS/JS with NodeJS and Express framework that is designed to help Prince George's County buyers and renters to have easy accessibility on building code violations of houses in Prince George's County. 

## Heroku Instance
Heroku instance can be found at this link: https://home-check-app.herokuapp.com/

## Target Browsers
While HomeCheck is built to be adaptive on browsers of any computer and mobile OS systems, we have only tested it on Chrome using Windows, iOS and Android. The version numbers are listed below:
- Chrome (Version 81.0.4044.129) on Windows 10 (Version 10.0.17763 Build 17763)
- Chrome (Version 81.0.4044.124) on iOS 13.3.1
- Chrome (Version 81.0.4044.117) on Android (Version 10.0)

### Installation and Dependencies
This project is stored in a Github repository, and you may fork it to your own repository and make modifications to it when cloned to your local repository. You may either choose to install GitHub Desktop or Git to clone it to your local repository. For GitHub Desktop installation and documentation, [click here](https://desktop.github.com/). For Git installation, [click here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and for Git repository instructions, [click here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)

Once you have cloned this project from GitHub into your local repository, you would need to install Node.js, npm, and Git in order for this project to work. 

- To download and install Node.js, [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). It should be noted that npm will automatically be installed along with node.js. 
- If you haven't installed Git yet, [click here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once you have installed Node.js, npm, and Git, open up gitbash console and navigate to your local repository that contains this project. Run the following code to navigate to your local repository. 
```
cd {project repository path}
```

Then, you would also need to install dependencies. In the file of package.json, you would find two sections: "dependencies" and "devDependencies." The "dependencies" section outlines the dependencies that are required for the application to function and the "devDependencies" section outlines the dependencies that are required for development of the project. Install dependencies from both section if you wish to modify or work on this project, otherwise, only install dependencies from the “dependencies.” Run the following command to install dependencies.
```
npm install –save {dependency}
```

You can also run this following command to install all dependencies.
```
npm i
````

### Running the Application on a Server

#### Running Locally
To run this application locally, you must follow the instructions listed in the Installation and Dependencies. Once you have cloned the project to your local directory, and have NodeJS and all the dependencies installed, navigate to the directory that contains the project and run the following command to start the server locally which will be hosted at `localhost:3000`.

```
npm start
```

#### Running on Heroku 
To run this application on Heroku, you must first create an account with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), and have this Github project forked to your Github account. After registering for Heroku, create a new app, name it appropriately, and then once brought to the deploy tab, click the GitHub icon to connect your GitHub account to your Heroku account. 

Once your account is linked, enter the name of the GitHub project when completing the App Connected to GitHub section. This should look something like "danstruble/INST377_HomeCheck". Once the project is connected, you can turn on automatic deployment of your project on the master branch, or you can opt for manual deployment, which requires you to manually load each subsequent GitHub push to your project afterwards.

After your Github project has been deployed to your Heroku project, you may access the application using the Heroku instance link.

### Testing

#### Postman
We tested the API endpoints of the server using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to ensure that our back-end is working correctly. 

#### Testing addresses
While testing for addresses from the databse on our application, we realized that we were only allowed to obtain 1000 rows of sample data from the Prince George's County. The 1000 rows of data can be found at their offical [API endpoint](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/9hyf-46qb.json). Hence, only addressed from the 1000 rows of data will work on the application. 

Some addressed for testing:
- 11505 Old Baltimore Pike
- 5341 Southern Ave
- 5809 Fountain Rd
- 7310 Leona St
- 1913 Campbell Dr

### API
Our application hosts the follow API endpoints

```
/api/search
```
This is a PUT request. This is called when a user first clicks the search button on the Home Page, and sends a JSON object which contains a keypair of "search", and the value being a string of the search term entered by the user. This will then set the session search criteria to be used in the results API. This API call also ensures that if the violation data has not been fetched from the PG County Interface, that it retrieves it. This specific call is asynchronous, which will prevent search results from returning without the dataset being populated on the server. After this call is completed, it will return a 200 code, showing it has successfully completed.

```
/api/search/results
```
This is a GET request. This is called after the /api/search call is performed after the user has searched for a location. Being a GET request, no data is required to be sent. This will take the session search which was set by the PUT request called previously, and search for a matching address in the violation set. If a match is found, it will return the geocoded coordinates of the location to display on the map, and the information about the location, containing violation data. This will then be displayed on the leaflet map.

```
/api/form/submit
```
This is a POST endpoint. At the minimum, a request with the body content of a JSON object consisting of a "name" field, "email" field, and "message" field shall be sent. This handles our Contact Us form, which enters what the user has submitted on the form into a local database currently hosted in the application memory. After the form has been successfully submitted, it will return a success message.

### Known Bugs
1. The Prince George's County API only provides 1000 rows of data when using their offical [SODA API](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/9hyf-46qb) and this limitation causes an issue that the map doesn't respond when an address that isn't in the 1000 rows of data is entered.
2. Sometimes searching for an address may take longer.

### Future Roadmap
1. Work with the Prince George's County to either request full access to the database, or create local or online database tha can store all the data. 
2. Add a response object that indicates if the search was sucessful or not.
3. Add a loader when searching for the address to help users that it's working. 
4. Incorporate more data from other counties, then expanding to other states.
5. Implement interface for discussion that can help connect buyers and renters with the updates that a home may have.
